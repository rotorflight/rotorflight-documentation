# Technical Reference

Developer documentation for the firmware: how its internals work, and how to
build, customise and debug it. These pages used to live in the firmware
repository's `docs/` folder.

Some of them describe mechanisms Rotorflight inherited from Betaflight and
Cleanflight, and still mention those projects; the concepts still apply.
