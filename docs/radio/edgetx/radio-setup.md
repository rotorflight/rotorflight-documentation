# EdgeTX Radio Setup

Setting up an EdgeTX model for a Rotorflight helicopter with an ExpressLRS
link. (With an FrSky receiver, use the FrSky channel order from
[Radio & Lua](../index.md#what-every-radio-needs) instead.)

!!! tip "Template model"
    [rotorflight-generic.yml](files/rotorflight-generic.yml) is a ready-made
    EdgeTX model with the channels and switches below. Copy it to the SD
    card's `MODELS` folder and adapt it.

## ExpressLRS module

Suggested ELRS settings for a helicopter:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Baud rate | 5.25M, or as high as your module supports |
| Packet rate | 500 Hz |
| Telemetry ratio | 1:8 to 1:32 (1:4 is fine with ELRS 3.5.5+ if the link stays solid) |
| Switch mode | Wide -- see the note below |
| Power | 250 mW, dynamic |

See the [ExpressLRS switch configuration](https://www.expresslrs.org/software/switch-config/)
guide for what the switch modes do.

!!! warning "Wide switches and the throttle"
    In ExpressLRS's *Hybrid* and *Wide* switch modes, channels 6 and up are
    sent at reduced resolution. That's fine for switches, but the
    governor's **NORMAL** and **SWITCH** throttle types need a
    full-resolution throttle. Either use the governor's **FUNCTION**
    throttle type, which is made for switch channels (see
    [Governor](../../setup/governor.md#throttle-types)), or use one of
    ExpressLRS's *Full Resolution* switch modes.

## Channels (ELRS order)

| Channel | Function | Example control |
| :-: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Aileron (roll) | Right stick |
| 2 | Elevator (pitch) | Right stick |
| 3 | Collective | Left stick, through a pitch curve |
| 4 | Rudder (yaw) | Left stick |
| 5 | AUX 1 -- **Arm** | SB, up = armed |
| 6 | Throttle | SF throttle hold + SE flight mode |
| 7 | AUX 2 -- Profile switch | SE |
| 8 | AUX 3 -- Rescue | SH, momentary |
| 9 | AUX 4 -- Blackbox | SA |
| 10 | AUX 5 -- spare | SC |
| 11-12 | AUX 6-7 -- adjustments | Pots or trims |

Pick the **ELRS** preset on the
[Receiver](../../configurator/tabs/receiver.md#channel-assignment) tab.

Leave cyclic and rudder trims at zero, and set no mixes on the cyclic or
tail -- the flight controller does all the mixing.

## Telemetry

1. Enable telemetry and custom telemetry on the flight controller -- see
   [ELRS Custom Telemetry](../../setup/elrs-custom-telemetry.md).
2. With RFSuite, save its **Telemetry** page to select the sensors it
   needs.
3. On the radio, **Model → Telemetry**: delete all sensors, start
   **Discover new**, and only then power up the helicopter.

## Flight controller side

- [Modes](../../configurator/tabs/modes.md): ARM on AUX 1, rescue,
  Blackbox and so on.
- [Adjustments](../../configurator/tabs/adjustments.md): profile switching
  on AUX 2 -- see [Profile Switching](../../setup/profile-switching.md).
