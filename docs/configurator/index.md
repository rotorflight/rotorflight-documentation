# Configurator

The Rotorflight Configurator flashes, configures and tunes the flight
controller. Run it in the browser at
[cfg.rotorflight.org](https://cfg.rotorflight.org), or install the desktop
app -- see [Downloads](../getting-started/downloads.md).

This section goes through every tab, in the order they appear once
connected. Some tabs only appear when the feature behind them is on, and
some fields only with **Expert Mode** on (the screenshots here are taken
with it on).

!!! tip "Looking for a procedure?"
    These pages explain what each setting does. For step-by-step set-up --
    servos, swashplate, governor, RPM filters -- see the
    [Setup Guides](../setup/index.md).

## Saving

Most tabs have **Save** (or **Save and Reboot**, when the change needs a
restart) and **Revert** at the bottom. If you leave a tab with unsaved
changes, the Configurator asks whether to save or discard them.
