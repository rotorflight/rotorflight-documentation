# Telemetry Sensors

Rotorflight sends its data to your radio as telemetry sensors: battery,
ESC, headspeed, governor state, profiles, attitude, GPS and more. Choose
which on the [Receiver](../configurator/tabs/receiver.md#telemetry-sensors)
tab, or with the `telemetry_sensors` setting.

## Protocols

| Protocol | How sensors are sent | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FrSky S.Port / F.Port / F.Bus** | Each sensor has an S.Port application ID (below). | The selected sensors are sent in turn. |
| **CRSF / ExpressLRS -- Custom** | Rotorflight's own frames, each sensor with a custom ID (below). Up to 40 sensors. | Needs a decoder on the radio -- see [ELRS Custom Telemetry](../setup/elrs-custom-telemetry.md). |
| **CRSF / ExpressLRS -- Native** | Standard CRSF frames: flight mode, battery, attitude, altitude, GPS, and (2.3+) RPM and temperature. | Works on any CRSF radio, but carries far less. |
| **FrSky Hub (D-series)** | Fixed set of hub sensors. | Legacy. |
| **FlySky iBUS / iBUS2** | iBUS sensor slots. | |
| **Futaba SBUS2** | Fixed slots -- see [Futaba](../radio/futaba.md). | |
| **Jeti EX Bus** | Sensors appear on the radio automatically. | |
| **Graupner HoTT, Spektrum SRXL / SRXL2, Ghost, MAVLink, LTM** | Protocol-specific sets. | |

## System Status and System Config

*New in 2.4.* Two sensors pack the flight controller's state into bit
fields, so a radio dashboard can show everything at once without dozens of
sensors:

**System Status** (ID 120; S.Port `0x5140`, CRSF `0x1230`) -- live state:
armed, airborne, motors running, RX link, failsafe phase, GPS fix and
health, spooled up, battery state, control saturated, gyro overflow,
accelerometer not calibrated, override active, rescue state, Blackbox
logging and governor state.

**System Config** (ID 121; S.Port `0x5141`, CRSF `0x1231`) -- slower
configuration state: PID, rate and battery profile numbers, unsaved
changes, saving, reboot required, beeper on, which sensors are present
(accelerometer, barometer, compass, GPS), Blackbox full, RPM source
active, and governor mode.

The exact bit layout is in the firmware's
[`telemetry/status.h`](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-firmware/blob/master/src/main/telemetry/status.h).
Both are in the default sensor selection.

## Sensor IDs

The **ID** is what goes in `telemetry_sensors`. A sensor can only be sent
over a protocol for which it has an ID in the table.

Sensors 110-117 are slots for forwarding FrSky sensors connected to the
flight controller -- see [FBUS Master](../setup/fbus-master.md).
